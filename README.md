## General Introduction

Humans would get completly lost if you let them walk in the desert for some time, but ants with a only 0.1 mg brain solve the task of finding home with ease. It would be great if we could adapt parts of their navigation skills.

## The Model

With our model we want to measure how much an ant relies on known landmarks for it's orientation in relation to its 'global vector' an estimation of its position based on its movement. We want to program the behaviour of a desert ant, and implement the model of Wehner, proposed in his thesis. Than we can compare our simulated results to his experimental data.

## Fundamental Questions

Is the model proposed by Wehner correct?
What dominates the ants navigation, the global or local vector?

## Expected Results

We suppose that our simulated data will be similar to the experimental data of Wehner. We expect, that the ants mainly use the 'global vector' as a base for their orientation.

# Reproducibility

(step by step instructions to reproduce your results. *Keep in mind that people reading this should accomplish to reproduce your work within 10 minutes. It needs to be self-contained and easy to use*. e.g. git clone URL_PROY; cd URL_PROY; python3 main.py --light_test (#--light test runs in less than 5minutes with up to date hardware))
