\section{Abstract}

\section{Individual contributions}

\section{Introduction and Motivations} %Josua
	\subsection{Motivation}
		we wanted to do an unconventional poject, simulating emergency situations has been done multiple times. Expanding horizon
	\subsection{Hypothesis}
		description of base paper (who did it, roughly what was it all about)
\section{Description of the Model} %Noah
	\subsection{Behavior of the ant}
		how did Wehner think global and local vector worked (\cite{wehner})
	\subsection{Conducted experiments}
		description of the experiments Wehner conducted (explanation of channel, cylinder, etc.)
\section{Implementation} % Noah
	with code examples
	\subsection{Main Concept}
		we use an iterative approach, calculate local and global vector new in every step, merge them together(explain how). Save steps, plot them
	\subsection{Global Vector}
		explain how it gets calculated, and randomized
	\subsection{Local Vector}
		explain how it gets calculated and influenced by surroundings
\section{Simulation Results and Discussion}
	\subsection{Simulation Results} %Josua
		what did we get, is it the same
	\subsection{Discussion}
		what was different, probably the randomization was no as in real life
\section{Summary and Outlook} %Noah
	\subsection{Summary}
		it worked pretty well, Wehner did a good job, his experiments corresponds to our simulation, which was based on his theory. We do not know if its biologically correct
	\subsection{Outlook}
		we probably will not continue our research about desert ants, maybe Wehner will
